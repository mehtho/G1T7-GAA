    "text": "Problem & Motivation\n\nSingaporean customer preferences when shopping for daily necessities is continuously changing. For example, there has been a gradual shift in popularity from wet markets to supermarkets, which is clear in younger estates such as Punggol, with fewer wet markets than some older estates.\nHowever, such trends are largely anecdotal, with even less known about how the prevalence of different supermarket chains, convenience stores, or other places of interest change in different neighbourhoods.\nWe would like create geospatial analytics application to allow users to address their various curiosities around this subject by visualising differences and patterns across Singapore."

Some reasons highlighted were labour and time efficiency. Time efficiency is particularly interesting, as they mentioned that due to the new trend of dual-income families, marketing had to become a faster and more efficient activity, replacing the notion of a wife spending the day at the market.\nThe article also mentioned the issue of succession despite a sentimental attachment to wet markets.\nIN FOCUS: Is there a future for Singapore’s wet markets?\nIn 2011, the government announced that it would continue building wet markets but focus more on the food-centre aspect, providing affordable food options in areas lacking them.\nFrom the above articles, we can see that certain estates developed between 1984 and 2011 may lack food centres and wet markets. We can also expect some food centres in newer estates. This motivates the use of spatial clustering to observe these patterns and confirm or disprove our intuition.\nThis article also motivates the inclusion of supermarkets, wet markets, and food centres in our clustering criteria\nBarriers to the advancement of modern food retail formats:Theory and measurement\nIn this study, it was noted that supermarkets have been adopted across all age groups but not far into the perishable products category. However, this study was not done using data from Singapore, which may yield different results. While this study used a different method from kernel density estimation to estimate the coverage of supermarkets, we believe it is a simple method to approximate the demand for wet markets. This is because if a wet market did not have enough demand and customer footfall to sustain itself, it would close down or be replaced, perhaps by a food centre.\nInspired by this article, we would like to pay more attention to the theoretical coverage provided by wet markets and supermarkets."
