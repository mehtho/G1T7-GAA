For example, there has been a gradual shift in popularity from wet markets to supermarkets, which is clear in younger estates such as Punggol, with fewer wet markets than some older estates.\nHowever, such trends are largely anecdotal, with even less known about how the prevalence of different supermarket chains, convenience stores, or other places of interest change in different neighbourhoods.\nWe would like create geospatial analytics application to allow users to address their various curiosities around this subject by visualising differences and patterns across Singapore."
