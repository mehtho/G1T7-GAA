## Abstract

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WhatTown involves Geographical Accessibility Modelling and Spatial Point Pattern Analysis to determine the coverage of various facilities and amenities essential to daily living in Singaporean neighbourhoods.

This will be done on publicly available data, encompassing supermarkets, wet markets, hawker centres, and other points of interest.

WhatTown aims to be a web application to guide users through the process of Exploratory Data Analysis, Geographical Accessibility Modelling, and Kernel Density Estimation without any technical skills required.

The flexibility offered by our application will allow users to address their specific, unique questions through intuitive and simple visualisations without any knowledge of code or algorithms.

## Problem & Motivation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Singaporean customer preferences when shopping for daily necessities is continuously changing. For example, there has been a gradual shift in popularity from wet markets to supermarkets, which is clear in younger estates such as Punggol, with fewer wet markets than some older estates.

However, such trends are largely anecdotal, with even less known about how the prevalence of different supermarket chains, convenience stores, or other places of interest change in different neighbourhoods.

We would like create geospatial analytics application to allow users to address their various curiosities around this subject by visualising differences and patterns across Singapore.

## Objectives

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We would like to build an interactive tool to allow users to

-   Compare the prevalence of different sources of necessities in different neighbourhoods

-   Visualise the coverage and convenience of different sources of necessities with a neighbourhood

## Main Features

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To meet the aforementioned objectives, we proposed 3 features of our applications.

1.  Exploratory Data Analysis (Shared)
    -   Filter points by type (e.g. supermarket, wet markets, etc.) and region

    -   Plot these points on a map

    -   Plot histograms of the number of points of interest
    
2.  Kernel Density Estimation (Chester)
    -   Generate KDE maps for certain facilities

    -   Overlay demographic information specific to each neighbourhood on a map

    -   Allow interactive zooming in and out for users to get a closer look
    
3.  Geographical Accessibility Modelling (Matt)
    -   Select facilities to model accessibility for
    
    -   Choose between differently sized hexagons and squares

    -   Allow users to choose between Hansen's, KD2SFCA and SAM accessibility modelling methods

## Literature Reviews

[No Longer “Dirty, Unhygienic, Crowded and Messy”: The Story of Singapore’s Changing Wet Markets](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-18/issue-1/apr-to-jun-2022/singapore-changing-wet-markets/)

In 1981, it was decided that no more new wet markets would be built, and the last 2 traditional wet markets in Jurong were built in 1984. Some reasons highlighted were labour and time efficiency. Time efficiency is particularly interesting, as they mentioned that due to the new trend of dual-income families, marketing had to become a faster and more efficient activity, replacing the notion of a wife spending the day at the market.

The article also mentioned the issue of succession despite a sentimental attachment to wet markets.

[IN FOCUS: Is there a future for Singapore’s wet markets?](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wet-markets-singapore-future-focus-footfall-interest-die-out-3689661)

In 2011, the government announced that it would continue building wet markets but focus more on the food-centre aspect, providing affordable food options in areas lacking them.

From the above articles, we can see that certain estates developed between 1984 and 2011 may lack food centres and wet markets. We can also expect some food centres in newer estates. This motivates the use of spatial clustering to observe these patterns and confirm or disprove our intuition.

This article also motivates the inclusion of supermarkets, wet markets, and food centres in our clustering criteria

[Barriers to the advancement of modern food retail formats:Theory and measurement](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3389&context=lkcsb_research)

In this study, it was noted that supermarkets have been adopted across all age groups but not far into the perishable products category. However, this study was not done using data from Singapore, which may yield different results. While this study used a different method from kernel density estimation to estimate the coverage of supermarkets, we believe it is a simple method to approximate the demand for wet markets. This is because if a wet market did not have enough demand and customer footfall to sustain itself, it would close down or be replaced, perhaps by a food centre.

Inspired by this article, we would like to pay more attention to the theoretical coverage provided by wet markets and supermarkets.
